# Breadth First Search
- tree generation as we go
- exploring all the nodes in the same level
- Storing the entire set of nodes is the problem, this also means that the process is slow. 

# Depth First Search
- expands the deepest unexpanded nodes 
- successor before sibling
- can also be called back tracking search ? 
- Risk : 

# Water Jug Problem 
State : combination of jug volumes (volume 1 , volume 2)
State space : set of all possibiities - (look into this)
goal : jug with 2 gallons 
goal test 


Initial State : 2 empty jugs (0,0)
goal : (0,?) or v(?,0)
