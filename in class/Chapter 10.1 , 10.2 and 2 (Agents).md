SYMBOLIC and NON SYMBOLIC AI


## Agents:
Model based and Agent based systems.
concerns in model based : 
	- reusability
	- is it really intelligent once the model is understood ? 
	- is it dynamic / can it deal with Dynamic situation

__For AI we specify problem as:__
	 a set of goals, a utility function for weighing the value of each goal, a set of methods, and a heuristic function for estimating how likely a method is to achieve a goal

Autonomy of an Agent : 
	Situatedness
	Adaptivity
	Sociability(of agents)

AGENT PROGRAMS : 
	Simple Refelx Agent:
	least intelligent and hard to build -> select action based on current percept, ignoring the past
	Model based reflex Agent : 
	current and past percept , still lacks choosing among possible alternatives.
	Goal Based Agent : 
	Goal centric approach. 
	requires awareness to reach the goal even simulate.
	complicated when there are multiple goals. 
	Utility based agent :
	actions to choose best outcome.
	success value is considered for each goal. 
	Learnning agent :
	rules/functions changes based on experiences of agents. 


FEATURES OF ENVIRONMENT : 
	Fully and partially 
	deterministic v/s Stochastic
	Episodic vs sequential : 
		each percept-action episode is independent of prior episodes
	Static vs Dynamic 
	Discrete vs continuous
	Single agent vs multi agent

## Questions
- Why name it perception, resoning and Action rather than input internal process and response ? 
- how is model bassed not a decision tree ? 
- How to provide autonomy to the agent ? 
	 a set of goals, a utility function for weighing the value of each goal, a set of methods, and a heuristic function for estimating how likely a method is to achieve a goal
	(is this truely autonomous because ot is dependent on the values)
- to face adaptivity should the agent be provided with a bigger set of rules everytime it hits a change? 
- Does sociability also mean agents interacting to the previous agents (what are the constraints here)?
- Can a random/stochastic become a derterministic (ex maze in beginning is random but later is known entitiy)
- Static, dynamic v/s deterministic, stochastic
