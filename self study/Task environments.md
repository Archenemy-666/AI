## Task Environment:
__Task environments are the problems to which rational agents are the solutions__
The flavour of the task environments, directly affects the appropriate design for the agent program. 

Under the rationality we were required to present __performance measure__, __the environment__, __agents actuators__  grouping these falls under the heading __task environment__.

	A[performance measure] --> B[Task Environment]
	C[Environment] --> B[Task Environment]
	D[Agent Actuators] --> B[Task Environment]
	E[Sensors] --> B[Task Environment]
```

- ==We call this as __PEAS__ (__Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors__)==
- ==In designing an agent, the first step must always be specifying the __task environment__ as fully as possible. ==

There are cases where we create an artificial environment defined by the keyboard input and charecter output on screen. Here we can say "this is not a real environment, is it?" In fact, what matters is, not the distinction between "real" and "artificial" environments but the  complexity of the relationship among the __(behaviour of the agent - percept sequence generated by the environment - performance measure.)__
